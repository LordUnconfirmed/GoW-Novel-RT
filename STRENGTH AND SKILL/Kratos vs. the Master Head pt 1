The three heads were too close together for him to engage them individually. If he went straight for the master head, he’d have to defend himself against attacks from both secondary heads. Going after either of the secondary heads would expose his rear or flank to the titanic jaws of the master. If he couldn’t take them one at a time, he’d kill them all at once.
   He launched himself across the deck as if he’d been shot from a ballista.
   The nearest head swept toward him as though to batter him right off the deck. Kratos overleaped the monster’s neck, slashing down with one of the blades. It chopped into bone and wedged itself at the joining of the skull and one horn; the chain snapped tight as a towline and yanked Kratos sideways into a whirl. He let the head’s swing wrap the chain all the way around its neck, leaving him standing on the top of its skull. Faster than thought, the other blade found his hand, then together they thrust deep into the head’s eyes. Accurate slashes painted the blade with a gooey mass of vitreous humor and sent the head reeling blindly.
   A looming shadow gathered inky darkness around him. The master head arrowed downward like a falcon the size of a house. Kratos stood and waited. The vast jaws of the master head gaped far too wide to pluck him off the secondary head with any sort of accuracy-especially since the secondary head was still whipping from side to side, faster and faster as it tried to shake Kratos off-and so the master head did exactly as Kratos had anticipated.
   Those gargantuan jaws closed around the entire secondary head, and teeth like the ram spike of a war galley chopped into the armored scales of the neck, trying to bite off the secondary head and swallow it-and Kratos-whole.
   But Kratos knew well how tough the scaly hide of the Hydra truly was. There was ample time for him to slip between the great teeth as the master head bit down and began to shake his head like a wolf worrying off the haunch of a deer. Kratos jammed one of the blades into the master’s lower gums, then used the chain to swing himself under the creature’s chin. There, he hacked into the scales with the second blade, while ripping the first one free. The master head roared at the sudden pain, releasing the half-chewed secondary head to collapse back into the sea.
   Kratos went on hacking into its neck close under its chin, where the creature couldn’t get at him. The remaining secondary head snaked over to strike like a viper at Kratos’s back-but getting one of the Blades of Chaos up its nose made it rethink that strategy. With the jagged blade firmly lodged in the sinus cavity, pulling back made the creature unleash a screech of pain entirely unlike anything Kratos had ever heard.
