 Near the archway, a slave was bound in some kind of punishment position-his wrists were shackled together and hung from a short chain affixed to the ceiling. The chain was just long enough that his toes brushed the deck as the ship rolled. He sobbed in a thready, broken voice, “Please… please don’t leave me here… please…”
   As Kratos moved toward him, the slave’s sobbing turned to screams. “By all the gods, I beg you… please!”
   Kratos came to a stop beside him. “If I help, will you keep quiet?”
   “Oh, bless you-all the gods bless you for a good and kind…” The slave’s voice trailed away as he finally managed to focus his eyes on his presumed rescuer. “You!” His voice was choked with awe. “The Ghost of Sparta-I know who you are! I know what you did! I’d rather die right here than be saved by you!”
   Kratos drew one of the Blades of Chaos and, with a businesslike flick of the wrist, slashed off the slave’s head. “Your prayer is granted.”
   The slave had been so close to death already that the blade channeled only the faintest spark of life up the chains. Kratos glanced back into the slave hold, weighing the prospect of gaining more strength and healing himself by slaughtering them all-but they were so sickly that killing them would be more trouble than their lives were worth.
   Kratos moved on.
