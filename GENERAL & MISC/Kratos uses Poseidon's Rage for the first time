  The master head reared up again, and the secondary head tried desperately to pull away, but the blade up its nose was lodged like a fishhook-pulling away only seated it all the deeper. The other blade was similarly set in the master head’s throat. Neither blade would rip free, and they could not be broken any more than the blade chains binding them to Kratos’s arms could be broken by any earthly force. So when the master head pulled one way and the secondary head pulled another, there was only one thing linking them that could be broken.
   Kratos.
   He screamed in agony as he hung suspended between the two heads trying to rip him in half. Muscles bunched in his massive shoulders, but even his preternatural strength was no match for the titanic power of the Hydra. On another day, Kratos would have died there-but the Hydra was a creature of Ares. And the prospect of being killed by a minion of his enemy fueled Kratos’s anger. More than anger. More than fury.
   It filled him with the rage of a god.
   And, just as when he’d entered the archway where he met Poseidon, he felt as if his bones were on fire, burning him from the inside out. Lightning blazed around him, causing the world to fade into a dim image of washed-out blue, and blasted along the chains to the blades. The flesh around the blade embedded in the master head’s neck exploded like a sealed pot left on the fire too long, scattering immense gobbets of smoking remains.
   The blade lodged in the secondary head’s sinus cavity had an even more spectacular effect: When the inner membranes detonated, they blasted shards of bone out the Hydra’s eye sockets, which popped the creature’s sundered eyes from its face. Fragments penetrated whatever the secondary head used as a brain; the neck collapsed, and Kratos fell toward the deck far below.
   As he fell, he reflected that the Rage of Poseidon had turned out to be more useful than he’d anticipated.
