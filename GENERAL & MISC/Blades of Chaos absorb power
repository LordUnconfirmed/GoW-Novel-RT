Kratos cursed himself for fighting them as if they were human.
   He no longer paused to slay them. Why bother? Athens and its people could not be protected by the destruction of Ares’s army-the god’s army could not be destroyed. Like dragon’s teeth, each beast Kratos might slay could be recreated on any spot, at any instant. Killing them did nothing but feed power to the blades-power that he didn’t need. To Hades with fighting. He would seek the Oracle, learn her secret, and then be on his way.
   As he should have done from the beginning.
