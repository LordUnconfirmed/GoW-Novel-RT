   “Do you have so little regard for my domain, Kratos?” The tolerantly chiding voice boomed like a tidal surge blasting into a cave-pocked cliff. “Ten years have you sailed my seas on your quests, without shipwreck or storm founder-is that not evidence of my regard for you?”
   “Lord Poseidon.” Kratos’s tone was respectful, but he did not bow his head. “How may I serve the King of the Ocean?”
   “This Hydra that plagues my beautiful Aegean is a creature of your onetime master, Ares. Its existence is an insult. I would have you destroy it.”
   “I plan to.”
   “ Know that thus far you have but scratched this monstrosity-its secondary heads, such as those you’ve destroyed, are without number. The Hydra barely notices their loss.”
   “Then how do I kill it?”
   “You must destroy the master head-the one that holds the creature’s brain. The master head is ten times the size of the others, and its might is near to limitless.”
   Kratos didn’t care about its might.
