“Oh, yes-one last thing now that I have made certain you have completed your mission for me. Here,” she said, holding out Medusa’s severed head, its face carefully turned away. “Take it by the snakes. That’s right. Careful you don’t look into its eyes yourself. Now, sling it back over your shoulder as if you were putting away one of those impressively large swords you wear on your back.”
   Kratos did so and felt the snakes evaporate from his grasp. “What happened? Where did it go?”
   “It will be there when you want it. Just reach back for it, and it will be in your hand, turned the right way and ready to petrify.”
   “How does that work?”
   “It’s magic. One more thing you should know: Being dead diminishes Medusa’s power.”
   “People won’t turn to stone?”
   “Oh, they will. They just won’t stay that way for very long.”
   Kratos stared directly at Aphrodite, waiting for the full explanation.
   “Ten seconds from a full blast from the eyes. And whatever you do, don’t lose it.” Aphrodite spread her hands and regarded him closely. “Athena wants it when you’re done. She has some use for it. Something about a shield… maybe a cloak? Well, no matter. You have destroyed the Queen of the Gorgons, and now her power is yours!”
   In an instant she towered above him like a mountain, as though her hair might brush the moon, and her voice rang like a great bronze bell. “Freeze and destroy them all with Medusa’s Gaze!” the goddess thundered. “Go with the gods, Kratos. Go forth in the name of Olympus!”
   Before he could draw breath to reply, he was in Athens once more. Ares still towered above the Acropolis, casting house-size gobbets of Greek fire on every side.
