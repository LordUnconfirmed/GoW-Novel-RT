   Athena caught her breath as Ares appeared on the battlefield and began to crush Athenians under his sandal. Zeus gestured, and the view dissolved to a vision of Kratos sprinting up the long roadway toward the top of the Acropolis, just as a mortal woman failed to save her infant from a harpy-and another harpy snatched up the woman and savaged her with its talons.
   “That woman is one of your worshippers!” Athena pointed at the bleeding woman. “Do you see?”
   Zeus frowned. “Indeed. In fact, she’s a priestess-that little building of hers is an inn, consecrated to me in my Zeus Philoxenos role.”
   “He thinks to destroy my worshippers,” she said. “Are you certain this priestess of yours was an accident? Perhaps he has aspirations for a higher throne.”
   “Please, dear child.” Zeus thrust out his finger and touched the woman just as the harpy ripped out her spine. The ruler of the gods sighed and drew back his finger, now dotted with a single drop of water from the viewing pool. He turned and flicked the water droplet high into the air. It caught a ray of sunlight, turned into a rainbow, then vanished.
   “There,” he said, looking satisfied. “She will be well judged by Aeacus at the gates of the underworld.”
   “Why do you intercede in this way for a simple mortal worshipper, when you won’t allow me to intercede for my thousands?”
   Zeus’s eyes flashed. “Because I can.”
   He held her gaze until she had to look away. Then he became once more caught up by the vision reflected in the pool. “Look-there, do you see him? He’s killed the harpy, but now a whole company has him cornered! Perfect!”
   “It is?”
   “Tell me, how many monsters has Kratos destroyed today?”
   Athena frowned. “Almost four hundred. Why?”
   “Only four hundred?” Zeus looked exasperated. “What is his problem? He will never reach your oracle this way.”
   She had faith in Kratos’s prowess. She would have even more if Zeus did not actively oppose him.
